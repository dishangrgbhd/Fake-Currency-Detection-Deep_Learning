# Nepali-fake-currency-detection using Deep Learning
For Final Year Project.

There are two sequential models(CNN) for fake 500 and 1000 currency detection.

I also tested with pretrained models(ResNet,Inception v3, MobileNet) but there were cases of severe overfitting and fluctuations(spike formation) in test and valid accuracy graph so opted to go for sequential models(parameters tuned) which comparatively gave the best results out of all.

Dataset for Fake notes for 500 and 1000 were obtained with the help of NRB(Nepal Rastra Bank).
